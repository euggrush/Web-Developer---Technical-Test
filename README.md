<!-- Installed Vue.js and created the template. 
Then linked Bootstrap 5 from CDN.
A bootstrap grid system has been used to create the page layout. 
Also, custom CSS was written for album images.
Fetch API has been used to fetch data from a local JSON file. Then used this data for displaying in the Vue template.
 
Tools used:
-Vue.js ( I consider Vue.js as a modern framework that is fast, reliable, and well-documented.)
-Bootstrap (Modern and popular CSS framework. Using to create responsive, mobile-first front-end web design. Fast and reliable.)
-Fetch API (The fetch() method is modern and powerful. Supported by all modern browsers.) -->
